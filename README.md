# Online-Shopping-Management
This is a project of Information System Analysis and design course, where we implemented a website for Online shopping management.

# Introduction
The rapid evolution of technology has transformed the way people shop. Online shopping has become a vital part of modern commerce, enabling consumers to purchase goods and services from anywhere in the world at any time. The **Online Shopping Management System (OSMS)** project addresses the growing need for businesses to manage online retail operations efficiently. As the market grows more competitive, businesses must adopt robust systems that not only ensure operational efficiency but also enhance user experience.

This case study explores and analyzes the current state of online shopping platforms by comparing two prominent players: **Aarong**, a leading local brand in Bangladesh, and **Gucci**, a world-renowned luxury fashion brand. Through this analysis, we identify best practices, highlight limitations, and propose innovative solutions that our OSMS project aims to implement.

- Dependent on reliable internet and device access  
- Requires ongoing backend maintenance and customer support  
- Limited analytics features for advanced data-driven decision-making  
- UI may require further optimization for mobile devices in low-bandwidth areas  

### Gaps in OSMS:
- No built-in chatbot or 24/7 virtual assistant for customer service  
- Lack of integration with third-party logistics (3PL) for shipping automation  
- No multilingual support for broader accessibility
